# Introduction

This is the second part of a two part course on Algebraic Geometry. The aim of this course would be to cover an equivalent of Chapters III and IV of Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry.
There is no textbook for the course but here are a couple of books that you might find useful:

1.  Algebraic Geometry, Robin Hartshorne (Graduate Texts in Mathematics, No. 52, Springer-Verlag, 1977)

2.  Algebraic Geometry II, David Mumford and Tadao Oda, Texts and Readings in Mathematics, 10. Hindustan Book Agency, 2010.

In addition, I recommend using the Stacks Project to look up definitions and proofs. The Stacks Project is a collaborative project that aims to provide a comprehensive reference for algebraic geometry. It is available at <https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/> .


# Schedule

The classes are at Hayes-Healy 127 from 2-3:15 PM on Mondays and Wednesdays.

# Assignments

There will be weekly assignments that will be posted here. The assignments will be due at the beginning of the class on the following week, preferably submitted via email. Please use LaTeX if you are typing them. 


# Grading

The grading will be based on the assignments for those who want grades from this course.


# Office Hours

I will have office hours on Mondays and Tuesdays from 03:30-05:00 PM. You can also email me to set up an appointment.
